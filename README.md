# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering involves product designing, development, testing, deployment and maintenance 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
development of programming language 
establishment of software engineering as a discipline 
rise of agile methodologies in 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements:gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
Design: creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture 
development: releasing the software to isers

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer
quality assurance engineer
system architect 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
provides comprehensive tool for writing, debugging and testing codes e.g of IDEs visual studio
software tool for tracking changes to codes and coordinating team work e.g of VCS Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
common challenges are ; changing requirements, tight deadlines, technical debt
strategies include, effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of task.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing; testing individual components or modules of software 
integration testing: testing interaction between different components or subsystems
system testing; testing the entire software system 
acceptance: testing the software against users requirements to ensure it meets the needs of the users
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible answer from an AI model.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt: talk about Sandwich 
rinefinement suggestion: as a professional, tell me how to make sandwich.
